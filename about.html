        <p class="paragraph">
    My name is Marissa Saidy. I am currently a senior at Eastern Washington University and my major is Visual Communication Design with a mior in art. I am interested in web design because I would like to be part of user inter face design in companies and create something that everyone can use. The reason I am interested in graphic design because I want to design things for the greater community instead of self profit like art.

    The most recent music I have listend to is a remix of a game's OST(orginal soundtrack) Undertale and American Beauty/American Psycho album from Fall Out Boy. I mainly listen to remixes, EDM, pop, and Punk music. My favorite book series is the Percy Jackson and the Olympians. I love the mesh of modern day and Greek mythology that the book illustrates.
